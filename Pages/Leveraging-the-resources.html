    <h1>Leveraging the resources at your hand</h1>

  </div>
  <div class="ArticleBody">
<p>Do you wanna learn new things? If yes then what are those things? You ask yourself! Nobody on this earth cares what you do, except few people.
</p><br>

<p>What if you are living in a developing country, you don’t have access to the internet, you don’t have a smartphone, you don’t know anything about the latest technology? What would your situation be? Just imagine!!!<p><br>

<p>If you have a smartphone today you can do pretty many things. You could learn almost everything online except for some practical kinds of stuff like swimming, driving, etc.</p><br>

<p>If you own a smartphone you can buy pretty much everything online. You can order on amazon,flipkart...boom... it will be delivered to you within a few hours or within a few days. But, these things cannot be done if you’re not having a smartphone and an internet connection.</p>

<br><p>The Internet is one thing that connects us globally. Something happening in the US today we can address it live in INDIA why? Because of the internet. Yes, of course,it can be aired through satellites but it doesn’t cover large audiences. Reaching a large audience is the power of the internet. It has made our lives more valuable, it has given the job to millions of people.
</p>
<br><p>Just imagine those people who lack these wonderful resources, they lack these resources because either they could not afford it or they are not exposed to it. You can laugh at me by saying who doesn’t own a smartphone today.  That means you don’t have any exposure to the real world or you don’t have exposure to interior parts of India. I have not traveled all over India, but I have  seen soo many people around me who doesn’t own smartphone
And they don’t have any idea what it is.</p>

<br><p>Uber and Ola are not everywhere, we are in a developing country and it takes a lot of time to reach everywhere and it is ideally possible to reach every corner of our country. Similarly, the internet.
</p>
<br><p>Just look around yourself you will find people who don’t know what smartphone is and how to use it ? Especially older people who are exposed to this technology recently. They don’t have any idea about the power of a smartphone.</p>

<br><p>Smartphones are literally changing the way we do business. It is making life far more than comfortable. We are in total comfort. Only the dark side of it is, you can know a lot of things by just sitting on a bed with a smartphone with no real movement. </p>

<br><p>The more comfortable you are the lesser movement you make. Yes, it happens with me too. But, I can come out of it pretty much easily and quickly. </p>

<br><p>But still, we lack resources. What kind of resources? resources like quality content to improve your skill for free.
</p>

<br><p>You can learn most of the things for free on the internet. But there is a lot of chaos in the system. You cannot find one single clean path in what you’re searching for.  The Internet can make you just engaged the whole day and with zero learning. Algorithms can make you dumb.</p>

<br><p>As humans, we are starving for a greater quality of life every day. I am definitely not a life coach, I am too young to become a life coach. And according to me, you cannot be a life coach until you become a little bit older with some kind of experience the society gives you and then you may become whatever coach you want to be. As I said we are starving for a greater life in the sense we want to improve our lifestyle every day.
Who the hell on this earth doesn’t want to improve the way
he lives? Each and every person on the planet want to live better. How to live better? I am definitely not touching this concept so it is completely left to you and it all depends what are the situations you are facing just I wanted to say that there are so many people around the world who lack fundamental resources. We must be grateful for what we have now, what we have today.
 </p>

 <br><p>Food is the ultimate thing for a human for survival. Then comes the rest. So, if we have this resource then we don’t lack one of the fundamental resources. Then you can think about the rest. And we must be grateful for that.

<br><p>If you keep on waiting for the right resources to come at you, then you don’t have any choice other than waiting you will be wasting your own time. You need to look at the available things at your hand. Do whatever you can do with that available resource.</p>

<br><p>I believe that you have all the resources you need at present otherwise you would not be listening to this right now. If you are listening to this then you surely have a smartphone with an internet connection.
</p>

<br><p>This shows that you have a lot of power within you. You can just level up the things you are doing by using the internet and smartphone. Probably, the next question in your head will be how can I use the internet effectively? You definitely need to find out the answer yourself. The only thing I can say is,just ask that question again and find out the answer yourself… </p>
